- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @baileyhamersly
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a frontend developer with 2 years of professional experience in React, Javascript and many many more years of casual experience with web development (going all the way back to my Neopets webpage).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Node.js, I'm super interested in moving towards a full-stack knowledge base.
-  I'm also trying to hone my skills with React - I've learned so much in just two years and I can't wait to learn more!
